# Contest-2-F1

Today,
I participated in a design contest Organised By Acciojob  where I was tasked with completing a design within three hours.
I'm proud to say that I successfully completed the design within the allotted time frame, and I was able to achieve a high level of accuracy.
I'd be happy to share more about the design process.
Task is to make a Employee Dashboard Desing by using HTML, CSS.
The goal of the design was [Accuracy].
To ensure its accuracy, I used a variety of techniques [Visual Studio Code].
Although I encountered some challenges along the way,
I was able to overcome them and ultimately create a design that met the criteria of the contest.
Here It's a Figma Link Of the Given Design :
